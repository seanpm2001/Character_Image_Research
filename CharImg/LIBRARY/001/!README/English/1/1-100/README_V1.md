# Navigate

[Go back to the lobby](/CharImg/LIBRARY/)

This directory showcases a library of common character images, starting from the experience of [@seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/) navigation is complex, so these helpful `README.md` files will be placed around to ease navigation

You are currently in the library lobby on aisle 1, located at: `///CharImg/LIBRARY/001/`
