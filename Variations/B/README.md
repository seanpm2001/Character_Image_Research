# Modern 2021 character image definition

In 2021, I pinpointed how character images actually work for me. Some people may rely on the older variant.

## Overview

Character images (can be shortened to: char imgs, char img, character img, char image, charimg, etc.) is a mental process my brain supports that allows easy manipulation of different characters/people/animals (fictional and real) where an image of the character that is of interest is inserted into a memory (for example, Vlad the Impaler for me is associated with difficulty breathing and memories of times when it was hard to breath)

Common character images can cause/fuel euphoria, depending on how well they stick to a memory, and how much happiness is gained from the insertion or viewing of the specific character(s)

Normally, only 1 character image is done at a time, but it can swap around between various images. The most I have ever had in 5 minutes is 12.

## Codes

Codes may be obsolete. They will need to re-worked. See variant A.

## Effects

Certain character images can be incompatible some bad side effects include:

> Nausea

> Mental overload

> Stress

> Extreme discomfort

> Shame

Some positive side effects include:

> Better mood

> Being more peppy

> Increased productivity

> Feeling of power

> Euphoria

> Reduction of pain.

## Incompatibility

When a character image is incompatible, it may put off side effects. For example, the breathing problem I had that is associated with Vlad the Impaler (which I will refer to as Dracula for the rest of this document) can cause the problem to be prolonged.

Character images bring back memories. Not all memories have to have a character image associated with them.

## Evil-personalities

Evil personalities can form, but depending on your moral standards, the evil will be stripped out of it. Unfortunately, even with the evilness stripped out, character images for the worst people, such as Hitler, Stalin, etc. may form and are still not good to have active. When you get to this point, you should try to replace them with a different, less-evil character image.

For me, these images have never lasted more than an hour, as I get rid of them pretty quickly.

## Duration

The effect of a character image depends on its duration since the last switch. Character images can only change if they are forgotten, or are manually changed.

My current longest running Character images (as of March 11th 2021)

GLaDOS (Portal 2 .vg) 800+ days

Wheatley (Portal 2 .vg) 784+ days

Non-existant (null .corrupt) 364+ -> 1800+ days

Aqua Sama (Konosuba .anime) 4+ days

## Questions

Current questions I have about character images:

1. Is this very common? (probably not)

2. Can character images be a form/be a part of Dissociative Identity Disorder/oldterm: Multiple Personality Disorder?
