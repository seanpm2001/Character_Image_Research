## Part of a series on [:octocat: `the psychology of Sean`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Seanpm2001-Psychology/)

Unfortunately, the human mind cannot be read with current technology, so psychological problems I deal with have to be figured out on my own. These definitions are just me trying to define mental patterns, and how I work.

> **Warning** Nothing on this page is medical advice or fact as of yet. I am not a doctor, therapist, psychologist, or physician. If you think you suffer from a similar problem, make sure to mention it to your therapist.

## Character images

### Overview

[Not to be confused with Dissociative Identity Disorder (Also known as Multiple Personalities Disorder)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder?useskin=monobook)

Character images (can be shortened to: char imgs, char img, character img, char image, charimg, etc.) is a mental process my brain supports that allows easy manipulation of different characters/people/animals (fictional and real) where the personality and background is emulated to my mental set. This affects the way I do things, but most of the time only internally. Strong character images can effect me externally. It has led to severe issues twice (as of 2023, Thursday, February 2nd)

It only takes a maximum of 1 minute and 50 seconds to develop a character image completely. It takes as little as 2 seconds to develop a character image.

### What IS a character image

I am still not sure. The following and preceeding notes will try and make sense of it.

***

### Codes

Notes: The order of codes goes as such:

- [ ] [1] Character name
- [ ] [2] Category code
- [ ] [3] Effect level (1-8 = normal, 9-16 = medium, 17-24 = high, 25-32 = maximum effect level)

- .ybind32 - This is an extremely rare code for maximum strength character images that only affect me internally
- .nobind32 - This is a code for strong character images that affect me both internally and externally.
- .vg - This is a category code. It is used for video game related character images
- .ppl - This is a category code. It is used for real people related character images
- .seas1 - This is a category code. It is used for season 1 (Spring) mood character images
- .seas2 - This is a category code. It is used for season 2 (Summer) mood character images
- .seas3- This is a category code. It is used for season 3 (Autumn) mood character images
- .seas4 - This is a category code. It is used for season 4 (Winter) mood character images
- .ctoon - This is a category code. It used for cartoons
- .anime - This is a category code. It is used as the second code in the sequence, and is for Anime/Manga related character images
- .other - Undefined

> **Note** **This section needs to be re-worked.**

***

### Still images

> **Note** I have a highly visual mind (my brain can play videos, images, and audio at any time) This may not apply to you

Most of my character images are still images.

***

### Effects

Certain character images can be [incompatible](#Incompatibility). some bad side effects include:

* Nausea
* Mental overload
* Stress
* Extreme discomfort
* Shame

Some positive side effects include:

* Better mood
* Being more peppy
* Increased productivity
* Feeling of power
* Reduction of pain.

***

### Incompatibility

When a character image is incompatible, it may put off side effects. I currently don't know how a character image becomes incompatible.

***

### Similarity to earworms

Character images can be very similar to earworms (catchy music/audio that gets stuck in your head, and loops constantly) but instead of being an audio worm, it is an image/video worm.

***

### Maps and non-living objects

Despite not having a personality, a map can qualify as a character image. The same can be applied to any non-living entity.

#### How can a non-living object have a personality

It is typically a merging of 2 or more different entities.

***

### Merging personalities

A mutated personality (or merged personality) is a character image made up of 2 or more character images. This is uncommon for identifiable images, but very common for character images that are not based on living entities.

*** 

### Evil personalities

Evil personalities can form, but depending on your moral standards, the evil will be stripped out of it. Unfortunately, even with the evilness stripped out, character images for the worst people, such as Hitler, Stalin, etc. may form and are still not good to have active. When you get to this point, you should try to replace them with a different, less-evil character image.

For me, these images have never lasted more than an hour, as I get rid of them pretty quickly.

***

### Duration

The effect of a character image depends on its duration since the last switch. Character images can only change if they are forgotten, or are manually changed.

My current longest running Character images (as of March 11th 2021)

### Quantity

My mind has hundreds (possibly thousands) of character images, but only 6 can be active per minute. Anything over this can lead to mental overwhelming.

***

### Notable incidents

#### 2021 March 6th (circa)

Character images overwhelmed my mind and led to stability issues. This was caused by Anime viewing.

#### 2023, January 29th/30th - 2023, February 2nd

Character images overwhelmed my mind again, and led to mental anguish, lack of focus, severe tension, and may have caused me to vomit. This may have been caused by Anime viewing.

***

### Questions

Current questions I have about character images:

* 1. Is this very common? (probably not)
* 2. Can character images be a form/be a part of [Dissociative Identity Disorder/oldterm: Multiple Personality Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder)?

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
